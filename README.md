## Mockup Screenshots

 Using the "Am I Responsive" website, here are three examples of the site showig responsivity.

## UX

- The design for The Cellar was created as a series of wireframes sketches covering mobile, tablet and desktop to determine the initial design and layout of the site.
- The Cellar site was designed to provide swift access to the The Cellar Discord Channel and information about current games.
- A bold and colourful layout is designed to provide a sense of fun and community.
- The Cellar expects to see repeated use and to be welcoming to people new to Roleplaying.

### Colour Scheme

- The chosen colour scheme for Your Weather is designed to be inviting and have a neutral aesthetic while giving a nice splash of colour.
- The colours used are as follows:-

- `#forestgreen` used for the primary logo and primary highlights.
- `#yellow`, `#red` and `#blue` used for primary highlights.
- `#blue` and `#ffffff` used for secondary text.
- `#fafafa` and `#brown` used for secondary highlights.
- `#3a3a3a` and `#252525` used for box shadows.
- `#a0a0a0`, `#fff` and `#000` used for border lines.

### Typography

- I used the Google Font called 'Chakra Petch' for The Cellar site.
- I felt that this font was both slightly futuristic and easy to read while fitting with the ethos of The Cellar site.

- [Chakra Petch](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Chakra+Petch) was used for all text within the site.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used in The Cellaar site, for GitHub links in the footer and the Game On page.
